abstract: A multimodal and real-time method for filtering sensitive content, receiving as input a digital video stream, the method including segmenting digital video into video fragments along the video timeline; extracting features containing significant information from the digital video input on sensitive media; reducing the semantic difference between each of the low-level video features, and the high-level sensitive concept; classifying the video fragments, generating a high-level label (positive or negative), with a confidence score for each fragment representation; performing high-level fusion to properly match the possible high-level labels and confidence scores for each fragment; and predicting the sensitive time by combining the labels of the fragments along the video timeline, indicating the moments when the content becomes sensitive.
