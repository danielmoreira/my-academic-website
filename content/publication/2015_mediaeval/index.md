abstract: This paper presents the approach used by the RECOD team to address the challenges provided in the MediaEval 2015 Affective Impact of Movies Task. We designed various video classifiers, which relied on bags of visual features, and on bags of auditory features. We combined these classifiers using different approaches, ranging from majority voting to machine-learned techniques on the training dataset. We only participated in the Violence Detection subtask.
