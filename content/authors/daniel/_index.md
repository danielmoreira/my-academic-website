My name is Daniel and I am a computer scientist.
I am currently an assistant research professor at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-notre-dame-0), US, and I received my PhD degree from the [University of Campinas](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-campinas), Brazil, in 2016.

As a member of the [Computer Vision Research Lab](https://cvrl.nd.edu/), I investigate the application of techniques from the fields of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Visual Media Forensics to make our [society better](post/bettersoc).
